	  Select this option to enable support for Broadcom
	  VK Accelerators.  VK is used for performing
	  multiple specific offload processing tasks in parallel.
	  Such offload tasks assist in such operations as video
	  transcoding, compression, and crypto tasks.
	  This driver enables userspace programs to access these
	  accelerators via /dev/bcm-vk.N devices.

	  If unsure, say N.
