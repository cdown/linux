Description:	Interface for viewing and setting per-console attributes, like
		the per-console loglevel. For a high-level document describing

		controls, see
		Documentation/admin-guide/per-console-loglevel.rst.

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/effective_loglevel
Date:		May 2022
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/effective_loglevel_source
Date:		May 2022
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>
Description:	Read only. The currently effective loglevel source for this
		console -- for example, whether it was set globally based on
		the default loglevel, or whether it was set locally for this
		console. Possible values are:

		local: The loglevel comes from the per-console loglevel.
		global: The loglevel comes from the global default loglevel.
		ignore_loglevel: Both the per-console loglevel and global
				 loglevels are ignored as ignore_loglevel is
				 present on the kernel command line.

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/loglevel
Date:		May 2022
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>
Description:	Read write. The current per-console loglevel, which will take
		effect if not overridden by other non-sysfs controls (see
		Documentation/admin-guide/per-console-loglevel.rst). Bounds are
		0 (LOGLEVEL_EMERG) to 8 (LOGLEVEL_DEBUG + 1) inclusive. Also
		takes the special value "unset" to indicate that no per-console
		loglevel is set, and we should defer to the global controls.
