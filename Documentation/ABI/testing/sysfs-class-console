Description:	Interface for viewing and setting per-console attributes, like
		the per-console loglevel. For a high-level document describing
		the motivations for this interface and related non-sysfs
		controls, see
		Documentation/admin-guide/per-console-loglevel.rst.

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/effective_loglevel
Date:		May 2022
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>
Description:	Read only. The currently effective loglevel for this console.
		All messages emitted with a loglevel below the effective value
		will be emitted to the console.

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/effective_loglevel_source
Date:		May 2022
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>
Description:	Read only. The currently effective loglevel source for this
		console -- for example, whether it was set globally based on
		the default loglevel, or whether it was set locally. Possible
		values are:

		local: The loglevel comes from the per-console loglevel.
		global: The loglevel comes from the global default loglevel.
		forced: The loglevel comes from the global forced loglevel.
		minimum: The loglevel comes from the global minimum loglevel.
		forced_minimum: A forced global loglevel is active, but it is
				below the global minimum loglevel. The loglevel
				comes from the global minimum loglevel and is
				forced regardless of the console's current
				local loglevel setting.
		ignore_loglevel: The loglevel is ignored as ignore_loglevel is
		                 present on the kernel command line.

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/enabled
Date:		May 2022
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>
Description:	Read only. "1" if the console is enabled, "0" otherwise.

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/loglevel
Date:		May 2022
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>
Description:	Read write. The current local loglevel, which will take effect
		if not overridden by other non-sysfs controls (see
		Documentation/admin-guide/per-console-loglevel.rst). Bounds are
		0 (LOGLEVEL_EMERG) to 8 (LOGLEVEL_DEBUG + 1) inclusive. Also
		takes the special value "unset" to indicate that no local
		loglevel is set, and we should defer to the global controls.
