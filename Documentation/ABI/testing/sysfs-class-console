What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/effective_loglevel
Date:		April 2023

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/effective_loglevel_source
Date:		April 2023
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>
Description:	Read only. The currently effective loglevel source for this
		console -- for example, whether it was set globally, or whether
		it was set locally for this console.

		Possible values are:
			=============== ============================================
			local           The loglevel comes from the per-console
			                loglevel.
			global          The loglevel comes from the global loglevel.
			ignore_loglevel Both the per-console loglevel and global
			                loglevels are ignored as ignore_loglevel is
			                present on the kernel command line.
			=============== ============================================

What:		/sys/class/console/<C>/loglevel
Date:		April 2023
Contact:	Chris Down <chris@chrisdown.name>
Description:	Read write. The current per-console loglevel, which will take
		effect if not overridden by other non-sysfs controls (see
		Documentation/admin-guide/per-console-loglevel.rst). Bounds are
		0 (LOGLEVEL_EMERG) to 8 (LOGLEVEL_DEBUG + 1) inclusive. Also
		takes the special value "-1" to indicate that no per-console
		loglevel is set, and we should defer to the global controls.
